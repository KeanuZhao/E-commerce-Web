There are all my web projects during my precious memorable undergraduate life.<br>
Project: E-commerce Website for Selling Lamps
¬	Implemented server through Tomcat and servlet to validate users’ authentication and response to their requests.
¬	Used MySQL to build database to store the kind, price, number of each lamp.
¬	Used JSP to structure the web page and to show all the commodity information dynamically.
¬	Worked based on Java/ JSP/ MySQL.
